# Web-Development-for-Beginners
In web development, we refer to website so web development refers to website development. “Web” word has been taken from the spider’s web because of the analogy that like a web is connected similarly websites are also connected to each other through the Internet.

History of web development
1989: Proposal for the World Wide Web
1991: First web page created
1993: Release of Mosaic web browser
1995: Introduction of JavaScript
1996: Introduction of CSS
1998: Release of HTML 4.0
2000: Introduction of XHTML
2004: Coined “Web 2.0” term
2006: Release of jQuery
2010: Rise of responsive design
2015: Release of HTML5
3 Pillars of web development
web development What is web development for beginners? In web development, we refer to website so web development refers to website development. "Web" word has been taken from the spider's web because of the analogy that like a web is connected similarly websites are also connected to each other through the Internet.
HTML – Hypertext Markup Language
The fundamental technology to create a website is HTML. HTML is called the structure of a website. With HTML, you can create a basic website with limited functionality.

JS – JavaScript
To increase the functions of a website, you will need JavaScript. You can call JavaScript the logic of your website. JavaScript is a programming language that is used to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to web pages.

CSS – Cascading Style Sheets
You can design your website with HTML only but it will take a lot of time and I bet no one uses HTML to design and uses CSS to design. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay out web pages, allowing developers to control the visual presentation of HTML elements.

How does a website work?
How does a website work?
When you hit a URL, the URL opens in a browser of your device by default, and the browser(frontend) makes a request to the website to fetch the data for that particular URL. The server (backend) after checking your request, fetches the data from the database and sends it to your browser which is then shown to you in your browser.

Frontend Web Development
Frontend as the name itself suggests is the interface of a website where the end user will interact. For example, you are currently reading this blog on my website copyassignment.com, now, whatever you are currently seeing on my website is the frontend side.

The frontend side can mainly be developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only but there are many new technologies(frameworks and libraries) available that are making frontend web development very easier as well as more advanced and fast.

All these frontend frameworks and libraries are built on top of CSS(in case of styling) and JavaScript(in case of easy, fast, and smooth web development).

Top Frontend web development frameworks and Libraries for Styling:
Bootstrap – https://getbootstrap.com/
Foundation – https://foundation.zurb.com/
Materialize – https://materializecss.com/
Bulma – https://bulma.io/
Tailwind CSS – https://tailwindcss.com/

Ember.js – https://emberjs.com/
Backbone.js – https://backbonejs.org/
Backend Development
architecture of backend web development
The backend is the part of any website that a user can not see or interact with. The backend is used to store data and process the requests received from the front end. For example, the text/paragraph you are reading in this “What is web development for Beginners?” article is stored at the backend part of my website copyassignment. You received this data/article from the backend when you used/clicked the link to this article’s URL in a browser.

While in frontend side, JavaScript and its frameworks and libraries can be only used, this is not the case with Backend, there are many backend scripting and programming languages available that you can use in your backend for processing and sending requests.

Top backend development programming languages:
Node.js – https://nodejs.org/en/
PHP – https://www.php.net/
Ruby on Rails – https://rubyonrails.org/
Django (Python) – https://www.djangoproject.com/
ASP.NET (C#) – https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet
Flask (Python) – https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/
Express.js – https://expressjs.com/
Laravel (PHP) – https://laravel.com/
Spring (Java) – https://spring.io/
Go – https://golang.org/
Database in web development
The database is a crucial part of web development as if you want to store any information then you will need some database like MySQL, MongoDB, Oracle, etc. For example, if you want to store data filled in a form having fields such as name, mobile number, age, address, city, country, etc then you can ask the user to fill a form at the frontend and when the user will submit the form then the data will be sent to the backend and then it will be stored in a database.

Types of database:
Relational databases:
MySQL – https://www.mysql.com/
PostgreSQL – https://www.postgresql.org/
Oracle Database – https://www.oracle.com/database/
NoSQL databases:
MongoDB (document-oriented) – https://www.mongodb.com/
Cassandra (column-family) – https://cassandra.apache.org/
Redis (key-value) – https://redis.io/
CouchDB (document-oriented) – https://couchdb.apache.org/
Graph databases:

ArangoDB – https://www.arangodb.com/
Object-oriented databases:

Conclusion
Web development is an ever-evolving field that has come a long way since the creation of the first web page in 1991. Today, web development is not limited to just creating a basic website with HTML but has become more advanced and dynamic with the help of JavaScript and CSS.

Frontend development frameworks and libraries have made it easier to design and create a website’s interface, while backend development languages and technologies have made it possible to process user requests and store data. Node.js, PHP, Ruby on Rails, Django, and ASP.NET are some of the most popular backend development languages used today. In addition, databases play a vital role in web development as they are used to store and retrieve data efficiently. MySQL, MongoDB, and Oracle are some of the commonly used databases.
